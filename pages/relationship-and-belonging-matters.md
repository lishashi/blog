I believe that building human connection is the top priority as a teacher. As James Comer says that no significant learning can occur if there is a significant relationship between the teacher and the students. Getting to know my students and sharing with them about who I am helped build a positive relationship with them right from the beginning.

Below is a board I created to show the students who I am. I let them tell me two things about themselves after I showed them the board about me.

In order to build a good relationship with students, I checked with students’ feelings regularly.

Below is an morning check in I set up while I was teaching in the Kindergarte. I integrated arts into this check-in activity. Students used the stickers and color to draw their feelings on the white glue.

Celebrating students’ strength and every small step is also important for building a trusting relationship between teachers and students. In this way, students feel confident about themelves and believe that the teacher cares abou them. I created a Math wall to display students’ math work and process while teaching 2D and 3D shapes in the grade-one classroom.

Every student loves small surprises. ,and I made every student a christmas bag before I left the classroom during my that placement.
