I believe that building human connection is the top priority as a teacher. As James Comer says that no significant learning can occur if there is no significant relationship between the teacher and the students. Getting to know my students and sharing with them about who I am helped build a positive relationship with them right from the beginning.

Below is a board I created to show the students who I am. I let them tell me two things about themselves after I showed them the board about me.

In order to build a good relationship with students, I checked in with students’ feelings regularly.

Below is a morning check-in activity I set up while I was teaching in a kindergarten classroom. I integrated arts into this check-in activity. Students used the sticks and paints to draw their feelings on the plate filling up with white glue.

Celebrating students’ strengths and every small step is also important for building a trusting relationship between teachers and students. In this way, students feel confident about themselves and believe that the teacher cares about them. I created a Math wall to display students’ math work and process while teaching 2D and 3D shapes in the grade-one classroom.

Every student loves small surprises, and I made every student a Christmas bag before I left the classroom during my third placement.
