I believe in students’ full potential and ability to complete tasks requiring high-order thinking.

This natural competency should not be discouraged by age, gender, or ethnicity.

While I was teaching grade one at the Roger Neilson Public Schoo, I did the reader’s theater with the students. Even though they were only in grade one, they interviewed others like a real journalist and they acted as if they were the characters from the story. Through this activity, they demonstrated great reading skills and a high level of critical thinking.

As Rita Pierson said, “every kid needs a champion”, I have been seeing myself as the cheerleader in students’ learning.  While I was working as a lead counselor at the Kettleby Valley Outdoor Center, I worked with two groups of 12 campers. In the beginning, Some kids in the groups were afraid of trying outdoor activities, such as rock climbing and archery. I always tried to be the biggest believer in them. I patiently demonstrated the essential skills in those activities, and sometimes I would do the activities with the students to encourage them to try their best in participating in each activity. I also shared how terrified I was while I was doing the staff training and how I overcame the fear and worries in the end. I always shouted, “you can do it!” and some other encouraging words to motivate the campers to achieve their goals for each activity.
