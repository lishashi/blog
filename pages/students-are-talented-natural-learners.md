I believe in students’ full potential and ability to complete tasks requiring high-order thinking.

This natural competency should not be discouraged by age, gender, or ethnicity.

While I was teaching grade one at the Roger Neilson Public Schoo, I did the reader’s theater with the students. Even though they were only in grade one, they interviewed others like a real journalist and they acted as if they were the characters from the story. Through this activity, they demonstrated great reading skills and a high level of critical thinking.

As Rita Pierson said, “every kid needs a champion”, I have been seeing myself as the cheerleader in students’ learning.  While I was working as a lead counselor at the Kettleby Valley Outdoor Center, I worked with two groups of 12 campers. In the beginning, some kids in the groups were afraid of trying some activities that were new to them, such as rock climbing and archery. I was the biggest believer in them, so I patiently demonstrated the essential skills in those activities, and sometimes did the activities with them to encourage them to engage into those new activities. I also shared how terrified I was while I was doing those activities during the staff training and how I overcame the fear and worries in the end. I shouted out, “You can do it!” and some other encouraging words to motivate the campers to achieve their goals for each activity.
