Below are the six main beliefs for my teaching philosophy

The key concept is in bold, and then further explained. Clicking on the key concept will bring you to the page on my site where this is demonstrated via my pedagogy.

# Every student is a talented natural learner who is capable of achieving their potential

When I was doing my placement in a forest school, I was amazed by how capable and competent the children were with their potential. For example, They built their own trail and hideout, they collaborated with each other without being asked, and they solved the power issue in the cabin after a horrible storm. I do not see myself as an all-knowing expert who is responsible for imparting knowledge to students. On the contrary, I view myself as a resource provider and a helper who follows students’ interests and needs. I am committed to designing relevant learning experiences to meet students’ needs and interests scaffolding their learning to the next level.

# Teaching should be focusing on the holistic development of every student

This Indigenous worldview sets the foundation for students to develop a good relationship with our land and the people around them. It is imperative to focus on the five domains of child development, including physical, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual development. Focusing on only one area of development will prevent students from reaching their full potential and developing a sense of self. The learning environment should be inclusive, comfortable, and responsive. Teachers should create a culturally responsive classroom where students feel they are accepted for who they are and valued for where they come from.  This kind of classroom is full of laughter and smiles as students feel welcomed and comfortable. Teachers are always using positive language, and students are using kind words to each other. In an environment like this, students will feel safe to take risks and not be afraid to make mistakes.

# Relationship matters, and belonging matters

Establishing trusting and caring relationships with students is my priority as a teacher. Nothing will happen if there is no trust in the classroom. When it comes to classroom management, it is all about relationships. Having a respectful and trusting relationship with their teachers, students are more willing to learn, more active in participating in class activities, and therefore have fewer misbehaviors. As Maxwell (2014) once said, “Students don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” Culturally responsive teaching is centered on helping teachers to build this kind of caring and close relationship with their students.

# Learning should be ongoing for both students and teachers

No matter whether students or teachers, we all need to be lifelong learners. As a student, the desire and curiosity for new things and new information should be what motivates them to pursue a better version of themselves and to become successful in the future. As a teacher, ongoing professional development is what makes an excellent teacher. It is important for teachers to continue reflecting on daily teaching practice and learning relevant professional knowledge, such as educational research and teaching theory.

# Assessment should be fair and equitable to all students

There are no two students who are exactly the same, it is important for teachers to make sure that the assessment they are using fits students’ learning needs and allow the students to demonstrate what they have learned. Some students might need modified expectations, while others might need alternative expectations. All of these are based on students’ needs and abilities. The goal of assessment is to help the students and teachers understand where the student is at in terms of achieving the curriculum expectations. The reason for doing assessments is to improve students’ achievement, not trying to categorize them into different learning levels.
