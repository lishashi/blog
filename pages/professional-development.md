As one of my associate teachers once told me that being a good teacher means that you never stop learning and most of the time you learn as you go.

Below is a picture of different teaching resources and advice my associate teachers have given to me. Each of the gifts represents a teaching area I need to keep improving. For example, I have learned different strategies and skills in running a guided reading program in my second and third placements.

Even though I am good at using technology in supporting my teaching, I was not very good with writing on chart paper or making posters with markers. Below is a picture of me practicing writing down learning goals on chart paper.

My primary goal for future growth is to keep learning effective and interactive instructional strategies in teaching different subjects. I also committed to working on my classroom management skills. As mentioned in my Annual Learning Plan, I will develop strategies to integrate social-emotional learning into daily lessons and activities throughout at least three subjects. Last but not least, I need to improve my communication and interpersonal skills. I want to become a leader in the school I am working at and in the communities I am involved with.
