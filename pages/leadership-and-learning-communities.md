# Community Involvement At CHPS

While working at Chris Hadfield Public School, I have actively contributed to the school community by organizing and leading the Language and Culture Exchange Lunch Club. Each week, I designed engaging cultural activities to deepen students' understanding of diverse cultures. Initially, the club began as an Asian affinity group, but over time, students invited friends from various cultural backgrounds. The club has since evolved into an inclusive space where students from different cultures can connect, share experiences, and build meaningful friendships.

In addition, I have been actively involved in the Cross-Country Club for two school years. I run alongside the students and offer guidance to help them improve their skills. This role has allowed me to support students in setting personal goals, building resilience, and fostering a lifelong love for physical activity.

Furthermore, I have collaborated with a colleague to coordinate the PALS program. Together, we planned safe and engaging activities for student leaders to facilitate with primary students during recess, promoting teamwork, leadership, and a positive school environment.

# Assistant Teacher for the club Young Women in Action

As an teacher candidate, I had the opportunity to get involved with two extra-curricular activities during my practicum at the Kaawaate East City Public School.

The pictures below were taken when we were having a discussion about the difficulties and challenges girls or women encountered in life. I initiated a conversation about recognizing our strength as women and taught the whole group to make Friendship Bracelet. Through this hands-on activity, those young women demonstrated their creativity and gained confidence in themselves. The beautiful bracelets showed how amazing they were and how much they cared about each other.

# Volunteering in the ukulele club

Another extracurricular activity I participated in was volunteering in the ukulele club during lunch break on my practicum. Because I had experience playing the ukulele, I helped the students with practicing the basic chords, and I provided descriptive feedback on their playing.

# Engaging in the Indigenous Communities

Besides extra-curriculum activities, I have been engaging with Indigenous communities.  I went to the Pow Wow celebration at the Curve Lake First Nation Reserve. I have also participated in the Tipi Talks to extend my understanding of indigenous culture and ways of knowing.

The first picture was taken while I was at the Pow Wow celebration. I tried the Indigenous Taco there, and it was delicious. The second picture was taken during the Tipi Talk. I enjoyed the cider tea and the bannock while listening to Nicole Bell talking about the Indigenous culture and how they lived in the past.

# Being a member of the Chinese community in Canada

As a certified teacher in Ontario, Canada, I still see myself as Chinese, and I am proud of my own culture. I have been engaged with the Chinese community in Canada. I taught Chinese part-time at Yipâ€™s Chinese School and the Mon Sheong Foundation Chinese School. Below was taken while we went to a national park to have a picnic gathering.

# Being a member of the Champlain College Residence Community

I have been working as a Residence Life Don at Champlain College. I am in the big community of 12 team members, and I also run my community of 45 first-year Trent students. I built an inclusive and responsive living community where all 45 students developed a sense of belonging, and I planned community experiences for students to interact and build relationships with each other.
