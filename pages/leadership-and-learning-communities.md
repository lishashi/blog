As an educator, I have the opportunity to get involved with two extra-curricular activities during my practicum at the Kaawaate East City Public School.

# Assistant Teacher for the club Young Women in Action

The pictures below were taken when we were having a discussion about the difficulties and challenges girls or women encountered in life. I initiated a conversation about recognizing our strength as women and taught the whole group to make Friendship Bracelet. Through this hands-on activity, those young women demonstrated their creativity and gained confidence in themselves. The beautiful bracelets showed how amazing they were and how much they cared about each other.

# Volunteering in the ukulele club

Another extracurricular activity I participated in was volunteering in the ukulele club during lunch break on my practicum. Because I had experience playing the ukulele, I helped the students with practicing the basic chords, and I provided descriptive feedback on their playing.

# Engaging in the Indigenous Communities

Besides extra-curriculum activities, I have been engaging with Indigenous communities.  I went to the Pow Wow celebration at the Curve Lake First Nation Reserve. I have also participated in the Tipi Talks to extend my understanding of indigenous culture and ways of knowing.

The first picture was taken while I was at the Pow Wow celebration. I tried the Indigenous Taco there, and it was delicious. The second picture was taken during the Tipi Talk. I enjoyed the cider tea and the bannock while listening to Nicole Bell talking about the Indigenous culture and how they lived in the past.

# Being a member of the Chinese community in Canada

As a certified teacher in Ontario, Canada, I still see myself as Chinese, and I am proud of my own culture. I have been engaged with the Chinese community in Canada. I taught Chinese part-time at Yipâ€™s Chinese School and the Mon Sheong Foundation Chinese School. Below was taken while we went to a national park to have a picnic gathering.

# Being a member of the Champlain College Residence Community

I have been working as a Residence Life Don at Champlain College. I am in the big community of 12 team members, and I also run my community of 45 first-year Trent students. I built an inclusive and responsive living community where all 45 students developed a sense of belonging, and I planned community experiences for students to interact and build relationships with each other.
