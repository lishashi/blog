When it comes to assessment, I created different ways for students to demonstrate their learning. For example, for studnets with low level of writing, I provided students with stickers and art materials to demonstrate their understanding of the different perspectives each character held from the story.

For students who needed to hear other people’s idea before formulating their own answers, I integrated gallery walk and group activities in my lessons.

For students with different learning styles, I designed different activities to have them demonstrated them learning. For auditory learners, I had them used puppets they made to demonstrate their undersntanding of the story The Three Little Pigs.

For kinesthetic learners, when teaching patterns in math, I had them use pattern blocks to created given patterns and explained their pattern verbally.

For visual learners, while learning different types of food and definition of healthy food, I had those students explore different types of food and created a healthy snack with their understanding of food categories and what they learned in the art class.

I ensured fairness is in all three tyeps fo assessments I have been inimplementing in my teaching, including assessment For learning, assessment As learning, and assessment Of learning.

As for assessment For learning, I used anecdotal notes to record what students said and their thinking during group work time.

Below is an example of my anecdotal notes about one student in my third placement.  I refer to my observation note when I planned lessons for the next day.

I also tried to provided descriptive feedback to the students when I evaluated their learning through their work.

Below is an example of how I used student work about knowing attributes of two-dimensional shapes to plan the next step for the student.

In terms of *Assessment As Learning*, I like to have students use their hands to show me how they feel about what they have learned.

Below are all the hand gestures I had students do to reflect on their learning.

I also like to do peer assessment so that students can assess each other’s learning.

Below is the Peer-Assessment worksheet I designed for students to evaluate their classmates’ 3D structure.

As for Assesment Of Learning, I provided clear rubric and tried to make it as fun as possible.

Below is a rubric I created for a cumninating task for grade-one student

I also integrated technology and one-on-one conferencing at the end of Spatial Sense Unit to make judgement about how much students have learned in that unit.

Below is the google form we used at the end of the unit of the 2D and 3D shapes. My AT and I pulled out students to do this assessment during the free-choice time or independent reading time.
