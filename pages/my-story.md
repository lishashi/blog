 I am an adventurous person who likes exploring new places and cultures. I was born and grew up in Xiangyang, a small city in China. When I was in grade 3, I asked my parents to send me to a boarding school in Wuhan, the capital city of my province. I stayed there until I was in grade 6. During the three years, I learned independence and braveness. I learned how to take care of myself and overcome challenges.

After graduating from high school, I decided to travel further, to explore the north of China. So, I went to Shijiazhuang University for my undergraduate. Over the four years there, I met people from different backgrounds and from different social classes, and I become fascinated by the stories every individual carried with them. Through those stories, I became more open-minded and learned how to think from other people’s perspectives.

In the fourth year, I applied to do my placement in a school located in a rural area outside of Shijiazhuang. It was through this experience that I realized how much I loved teaching and how amazing it would be to be a teacher. So, when I went back to the university, I registered myself for the teaching program. Later, I passed the teacher license examination and received my teaching certificate in History.

While studying the teaching program in China, I came across teaching theories such as Skinner’s behaviourist theory of learning and Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory. So I decided to go abroad to deepen my understanding of different teaching theories and approaches.  I applied for Western University in 2016 and completed my Master’s degree there.

Now, I am a second-year teacher candidate at Trent University. Throughout the BEd program,  I have spent a lot of time reflecting on who I am and what kind of identity I can bring to my future classroom. When reflecting on my own experience of pursuing higher education, I realized that I am the kind of teacher who would be adventurous in getting engaged with communities from diverse backgrounds. I will be passionate about getting to know all my students no matter whether they are from minority groups or majority groups. I would go the extra mile to try everything to meet every student’s needs and interests.

There are several people in my life who have influenced me greatly in becoming who I am today. The first group of people is my parents. Even though they did not want me to go abroad after my undergraduate, they still respected me and supported me in pursuing a Master’s degree. Then, it is my young brother, who went to study in the USA when he was only 16 years old. His learning experience inspired me to broaden my horizon and not be afraid of getting out of my comfort zone. The last person is my partner, Wenjun Zhang. It was he who encouraged me to go back to the BEd program to achieve my dream of being a qualified teacher in Canada. He is one of the biggest supporters in my life. With all the support I have been receiving over years, I become who I am today, an adventurous and brave person.
