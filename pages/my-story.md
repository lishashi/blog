I am an adventurous person who likes exploring new places and cultures.

I was born and grew up in Xiangyang, a small city in China. When I was in grade 3, I asked my parents to send me to a boarding school in Wuhan, the capital city of my province. I stayed there until I was in grade 6. During the three years, I learned independence and braveness. I learned how to take care of myself and overcome challenges.



After graduating from high school, I decided to travel further, to explore the north of China.

So, I went to Shijiazhuang University for my undergraduate. Over the four years there, I met people from different backgrounds and from different social classes, and I become fascinated by the stories every individual carried with them. Through those stories, I became more open-minded and learned how to think from other people’s perspectives.

In the fourth year, I applied to do my placement in a school located in a rural area outside of Shijiazhuang. It was through this experience that I realized how much I loved teaching and how amazing it would be to be a teacher. So, when I went back to the university, I registered myself for the teaching program. Later I passed a licensing exam and received my teaching certificate.

While studying education in China, I came across teaching theories such as Skinner’s behaviourist theory of learning and Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory. So I decided to go abroad to deepen my understanding of different teaching theories and approaches.  I applied for Western University in 2016 and completed my Master’s degree there.

After working at the Royal Cachet Montessori School for a year, I applied to the Bachelor of Education (BEd) program at Trent University. I successfully completed the program in April 2023 and became a supply teacher with the Simcoe County District School Board. Throughout the BEd program, I spent significant time reflecting on my identity as an educator and the values I aim to bring into my future classrooms. Reflecting on my own journey in higher education, I discovered that I am a teacher who thrives on building connections with communities from diverse backgrounds. I am passionate about getting to know all my students, regardless of whether they belong to minority or majority groups. I am committed to going the extra mile to meet every student’s unique needs and interests.

Currently, I am an elementary school teacher at Chris Hadfield Public School, which I consider my second home. I deeply enjoy working with the students and collaborating with my colleagues, who are exceptional educators. Most of all, I look up to our principal, Heather Rocca, who has been incredibly supportive and has provided me with numerous opportunities to grow as a teacher. Over the past two years at Chris Hadfield PS, I have gained valuable practical teaching experience and refined my teaching philosophy. I am now more confident in my classroom management skills and have a deeper understanding of how to support students with diverse needs and learning levels.

There are several people in my life who have influenced me greatly in becoming who I am today. The first group of people is my parents. Even though they did not want me to go abroad after my undergraduate, they still respected me and supported me in pursuing a Master’s degree. Then, it is my young brother, who went to study in the USA when he was only 16 years old. His learning experience inspired me to broaden my horizon and not be afraid of getting out of my comfort zone. The last person is my partner, Wenjun Zhang. It was he who encouraged me to go back to the BEd program to achieve my dream of being a qualified teacher in Canada. He is one of the biggest supporters in my life. With all the support I have been receiving over years, I become who I am today, an adventurous and brave person.
