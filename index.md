>The gardener does not make a plant grow. The job of a gardener is to create
optimal conditions for growth. -- Ken Robinson

The quote above represents how I view myself as a teacher and how education
should be for students. I believe that every student is like a seed under the
ground, which has tons of possibilities and is capable of fulfilling its
potential. As a teacher, I see myself as a facilitator and resource provider
whose priority is to provide students with appropriate support and to create a
comfortable and optimal learning environment where all students feel welcomed
and included. I hope I could continue making efforts to know my students no
matter how long I have been with them. I want to be like a caring gardener who
could create an environment where students feel they are valued and supported
in becoming who they want to be.

This ePortfolio is a miniature of who I am, where I am from, and where I am
going as a new teacher. This website will be a place for me to document my
journey of growing and reflecting.  I will be updating and adding more content
as I go.
